If you're constantly switching between Debug, Adhoc/Beta, and Release builds of your app, it can be very helpful to have unique app icons for each configuration. You can easily tell at a glance which version is installed, your beta testers send you better feedback, a lasting world peace takes hold &mdash; everyone wins! Best of all, with Xcode 5+'s asset catalogs, there's no code required.

Here's how this looks in my app [MUDRammer - A Modern MUD Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mudrammer-a-modern-mud-client/id597157072?mt=8):

|  |  |
|:-|:--|
| <img src="/img/mr-dev.png" width="90" height="90" alt="MUDRammer Debug" /> | &nbsp;&nbsp;Debug | 
| <img src="/img/mr-adhoc.png" width="90" height="90" alt="MUDRammer Adhoc/Beta" /> | &nbsp;&nbsp;Adhoc/Beta |
| <img src="/img/mr-release.png" width="90" height="90" alt="MUDRammer Release" /> | &nbsp;&nbsp;Release |

Start by adding one or two new App Icon image sets to your asset catalog: click the `+` in your asset catalog &rarr; `New App Icon`. (Your app doesn't use an asset catalog? Xcode will create one for you on your project's `General` tab. Go ahead, I'll wait.)

Give your new App Icon image sets some memorable names. Mine are `AppIconRelease`, `AppIconAdhoc`, and `AppIconDebug`.

In your application target's build settings, scroll down to `Asset Catalog Compiler - Options` and expand the arrow next to `Asset Catalog App Icon Set Name`. By default, you'll see the same App Icon set for all of your app's configurations. Now it's just a matter of assigning your App Icon set names to the proper configurations for your app.

Here's some caution tape. Be careful out there!

For bonus points, start continuously integrating your iOS app. Here's [my build script](https://github.com/splinesoft/SSBuild)!
